/*
 * Drawing is where the action happens.
 * 
 * The Drawing constructor should accept a File parameter indicating 
 * what instruction file to utilize.  It will need to create a 
 * Scanner pointing to the file.
 * 
 * It should also accept a ShapeLibrary parameter, which refers
 * to a fully filled-in library of shapes to utilize for drawing.
 * 
 * It should then use the appropriate Utility static methods
 * to ask for the retrieval of one CanvasInstruction, and create
 * a loop to ask for the retrieval of as many DrawInstruction 
 * objects as there are drawing instruction lines in the file.
 * You may decide to do the latter by saving all the drawing
 * instructions into an ArrayList, for later processing, or by
 * reading each drawing instruction and processing it immediately.
 * 
 * You must then do the work of drawing.  In some cases that will 
 * involved some transforms on the data, e.g., if the instruction
 * file says to draw the shape at (250, 100), then you must make
 * that happen.  Size is another transform that you'll need to 
 * handle.  Make sure to handle transforms in the proper order,
 * e.g., do you size first, then shift later, or the reverse?
 * 
 * When it comes to drawing the shape, you only need a couple of
 * basic Graphics methods.  You'll need .setColor() to change 
 * to the color you're about to draw with.  You'll also need
 * .drawPolygon() and .fillPolygon().  For extra credit a few
 * other methods will be necessary.
 * 
 * Do not use Graphics2D to do any of this work, regular or 
 * extra credit.  Use simple graphics commands and math to
 * accomplish these tasks.
